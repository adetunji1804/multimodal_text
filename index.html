                                    Plastic has many valuable uses which has transformed the modern age, life without it 
                                    would be unrecognizable today. While It revolutionized medicine with life-saving devices, 
                                    made space travel possible, lightened cars and jets-saving fuel, saved lives with helmets, 
                                    incubators, and container for clean drinking water; the rate of plastic production has 
                                    grown faster than that of any other material, we have also seen a shift away from the 
                                    production of durable plastic, and towards plastics that are meant to be thrown away after 
                                    a single use.

                                    Man, in his nonchalant attitude has made this useful material a pollutant to 
                                    the environment. To avert the foreseeable consequences of this menace, there should be 
                                    strict enforcement to back government policy against the use of plastic, plastic recycling 
                                    machines should be improved on[size wise] like the paper shreaded machine and be made 
                                    affordable, individuals, volunteers, agencies should support the movement against the use 
                                    of plastic and public awareness should be intensified.

                                    <p>
                                        Every year, about 8 million tons of plastic waste escapes into the oceans from 
                                        coastal nations. That’s the equivalent of setting five garbage bags full of 
                                        trash on every foot of coastline around the world and so, plastic waste is now 
                                        so abundant in the natural environment that scientists have even suggested it 
                                        could serve as an indicator of the current geological age. More than 8 million 
                                        tons of discarded plastic ends up in our oceans every single year. Once it is 
                                        there, it does not readily go away. Most of the plastic trash in the oceans flows 
                                        from land and carried to sea by major rivers, which act as conveyor belts, picking 
                                        up more and more trash as they move downstream. Once at sea, much of it remains in 
                                        coastal waters, but once caught up in ocean currents, it can be transported around 
                                        the world.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We need to slow the flow of plastic at its source, but we also need to improve the 
                                        way we manage our plastic waste. Because right now, a lot of it ends up in the environment, 
                                        with 9% recycled, 12% incinerated, while the rest [79%] is accumulated in landfills, dumps, 
                                        or the natural environment (<a class="tm-text-cyan mb-0" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/habitats/plastic-pollution/">UN Environment</a>). Cigarette butts, whose filters contain tiny
                                        plastic fibers were the most common type of plastic waste found in the environment in a recent 
                                        global survey. Drink bottles, bottle caps, food wrappers, grocery bags, drink lids, straws 
                                        and stirrers were the next most common items. Many of us use these products every day, 
                                        without even thinking about where they might end up.

                                        The conveniences plastics offer, however, led to a throw-away culture that reveals the 
                                        material’s dark side. Concern is growing over widespread plastic waste that is threatening 
                                        marine life with conservative yearly estimates of $13 billion in financial damage to marine 
                                        cosystems, according to two reports issued at the inaugural meeting of the United Nations. 
                                        “Marine plastic litter pollution is already affecting more than 800 marine species through 
                                        ingestion, entanglement and habitat change,” says head of UN Environment’s coral reef unit, 
                                        Jerker Tamelander. Hundreds of millions of people and industries worth billions of dollars 
                                        depend on healthy shallow water coral reefs. Yet, these fragile ecosystems are under threat 
                                        from human activity, including climate change and pollution. As a result, we are now seeing 
                                        unprecedented levels of decline in reef health and coral cover across the globe.
                                    </p>

                                        The plastic debris harms physical habitats, threatens aquatic life, and interferes with human 
                                        uses of river, marine and coastal environments. As reported by Plastic Ocean, plastic 
                                        pollution kill marine mammals directly through entanglement in objects such as fishing 
                                        gear and through ingestion, by being mistaken for food. Studies have found that all kinds 
                                        of species, including small zooplankton, large cetaceans, most seabirds, and all marine 
                                        turtles, readily ingest plastic bits and trash items such as cigarette lighters, plastic 
                                        bags, and bottle caps. Sunlight and seawater embrittle plastic, and the eventual breakdown 
                                        of larger objects into microplastics makes plastic available to zooplankton and other small 
                                        marine animals. Such small pieces of plastic, which are less than 5 mm (0.2 inch) in length, 
                                        make up a sizable fraction of plastic waste in the oceans. New research shows that larval 
                                        fish are eating nanofibers in the first days of life, raising new questions about the effects 
                                        of plastics on fish populations

                                        There are so many things each of us can do to prevent plastic waste from entering rivers 
                                        and seas. Many scientists and conservationists including the National Geographic Society 
                                        suggested improved waste management systems and recycling, better product design that 
                                        takes into account the short life of disposable packaging, and reduction in manufacturing 
                                        of unnecessary single-use plastics. The world is waking up to the problem, and governments 
                                        are starting to act. Though, strict enforcement of government policy against the use and 
                                        production of plastic is needed,  there are number of things they can do; from intensify 
                                        running public awareness campaigns, to offering incentives for recycling, to even banning 
                                        certain products outright.

                                        Individuals can ask the restaurants they frequent, to stop using 
                                        plastic straws, bringing their own coffee mug to work, and pressuring the local authorities 
                                        to improve how they manage their city’s plastic waste. Also, it will go a great mile if 
                                        individual can come together as volunteer and at there leisure provide support by cleaning
